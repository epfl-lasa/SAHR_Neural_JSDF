# PRM
PRM in 2D and 16D have been implemented. 




## problems
- repeated nodes in the path. Might be due to the small k0 (number of neighbor)
- how to set the **threshold** to decide that the robot has arrived one node?
- how to decide the number of nodes?
- The impedance controller of the hand needs to be refined so that it could 
have a good position tracking performance.
- collision check takes too much time in the realtime loop
